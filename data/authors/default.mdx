Hello there! I'm Hilmy Veradin, a Product Engineer specializing in the Apple ecosystem, based in Indonesia.

While my primary focus is native iOS development, I also have experience in frontend web development.

In the iOS field, I was selected as a [Google Summer of Code Contributor 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/RHtM4Lyc). In 2022, I graduated from the Apple Developer Academy @BINUS (the first Apple Developer Academy in Asia), was chosen as one of the WWDC 2022 Scholars, and completed a one-year internship as an iOS Developer at **[Mekari](https://www.talenta.co/)**, a leading SaaS company in Indonesia.

Currently, I'm working as a Fullstack Engineer on [CobaUjian.com](https://cobaujian.com), a comprehensive Indonesian exam platform. We've already helped more than 3,000 students across Indonesia through our app.
