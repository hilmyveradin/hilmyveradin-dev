Hello there. I’m Hilmy Veradin, a Software Engineer based in Indonesia. Currently, I’m building [CobaUjian](https://cobaujian.com), a one-stop Indonesian exam platform, as a Fullstack Engineer.

I work mostly on Web and native iOS Development. Recently, I was selected as a [Google Summer of Code Contributor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/RHtM4Lyc). In 2022, I graduated from the Apple Developer Academy @BINUS (the first Apple Developer Academy in Asia), was selected as one of the WWDC 2022 Scholars, and spent a one-year internship as an iOS Developer at **[Mekari](https://www.talenta.co/)**, a leading SaaS company in Indonesia.

For more information about my professional journey and interests, feel free to explore my [projects](/projects), [blog](/blog), and various social media profiles.
