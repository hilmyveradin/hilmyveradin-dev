### **My Journey - Understanding the App and its Origins**

Over the past month, I worked on a not-so-serious side project called **[focusstopwatch.com](https://focusstopwatch.com/)** (It’s open source. you can access the code [here](https://github.com/hilmyveradin/focusstopwatch-vue). The site's purpose? To keep track of your focus time, enabling you to specify tasks and later evaluate your performance. The concept came to me after feeling unsatisfied with existing focus/study systems. The traditional [Pomodoro](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) method, for example, didn't quite suit me. I needed a tool to accurately measure my productivity. Hence, FocusStopwatch concept became my go-to

With the idea ready, I asked myself: Which tools should I use to bring this app to life? Being a newbie in web development, I thought experimenting with new frameworks, UI libraries, and a backend service would be interesting. After some research and advice from friends, I settled on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Tailwind.CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (previously, I'd only tried [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)).

With my toolbox ready, and idea clear, what is left is execution!

### Important note - Constraint and expectation from reading this articles

This article is primarily about my journey. It focuses on "**what I understand**" and "**what has worked for me.**" Bear in mind, I may not have strictly followed best practices, and some of my knowledge might not be entirely accurate. Also, I won't dive deeply into each tool. After reading this, I encourage you to cross-verify the information with official sources or documentation related to the tools (Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase).

<div id="getting-to-know-vuejs---my-takeaways" />
### **Getting to Know Vue.js**

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a progressive JavaScript framework that was first released in 2014. Its creator, Evan You, wanted to extract the parts he liked about Angular, a framework he had been using at Google, and create something lightweight and flexible.

The magic of Vue.js lies in its blend of the best parts of React and AngularJS. Like React, it offers a virtual DOM, while it embraces two-way data binding like Angular. This combination provides an excellent balance, making Vue.js a pleasure to work with, especially with it’s reactivity api

I chose Vue 3 for my project. This version offers two main APIs styles - [**Options and Composition**](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#api-styles). I went with the Composition API because it provides a set of function-based APIs that are flexible and composable. This means I could easily extract, share, and reuse logic between components - a feature I found super helpful.

### Exploring Tailwind CSS - My Insights

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that was first introduced in 2017. The idea behind its creation was to reduce the time developers spend fighting with CSS and instead provide them with low-level utility classes to build custom designs.

The strength of Tailwind CSS is its approach to providing standardized CSS elements, allowing for speedier development as compared to Vanilla CSS. Why? Because it has inline style - you just apply pre-existing classes directly in your HTML. With a consideration that my app is not proven good and want to ship it as soon as possible, Tailwind is one of the best choice (not to mention it’s popularity in the community that might be benefits me in the future)

<div id="understanding-supabase---my-observations" />
### **Understanding Supabase**

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open-source Firebase alternative that was launched in 2020. It provides a suite of tools including a real-time database, authentication, storage, serverless functions - essentially, it's a one-stop-shop for developers.

What made Supabase stand out to me was its simplicity. It let me focus more on the front-end of my app, without worrying too much about the backend. Supabase provides GUIs that can help me experiment and configure things faster. Plus, Supabase offers ready-to-use templates and has incredibly well-documented guides, making it a beginner-friendly platform.

### **Oops Moments and Lessons from Vue.js**

During the development phase, I wavered between APIs - first using the Options API, then switching to the Composition API. This caused some unnecessary delay. The reason why I choose Options API from the first place is because according to the Vue.js official documentation, I should use Options API for low-complexity scenario (which is suitable to my current app). But after exploring more about Composition API, I thought rewriting it will be better in terms of maintainability (the ref usage, less lines of code, and more straightforward). The lesson here? Be sure about your tech choices before you dive deep into the development process.

Also, I struggled a bit with understanding Vue's [reactivity system](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth.html). But after spending some time on it, I learned that reactivity is one of Vue's core features and understanding it can save a lot of debugging time in the future.

APIs that I used in FocusStopwatch.com, are:

1. **Ref** to handle property/variables in react (It’s pretty similar to useState in React): [here](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#ref)
2. **Watch** to dismiss/show alert: [here](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#watch)
3. **onMounted** to detect sign in/sign out status: [here](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-lifecycle.html#onmounted)
4. **computed** to count and display the stopwatch’s seconds: [here](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#computed)

### **Trip-ups and Takeaways from Using Tailwind CSS**

While Tailwind CSS accelerates development speed, my initial lack of knowledge about CSS slowed me down. So, I decided to revisit CSS basics before proceeding further. The key takeaway here is that to Always master the basics before jumping into a framework or library!

CSS concept that I used in [FocusStopwatch.com](https://FocusStopwatch.com), that I wish I understand it sooner are:

1. **CSS FlexBox** to create the “container” of the view: [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)
2. difference between **px** and **rem** in CSS unit (since unit in Tailwind is using **rem**). You can read the article [here](https://austingil.com/px-or-rem-in-css/#:~:text=Pixels%20are%20an%20absolute%20unit,the%20equivalent%20of%2024%20pixels).
3. More CSS practice in general. There’s no rocket science in understanding CSS

## **Snags and Learning Experiences with Supabase**

On the Supabase front, I realized I'd forgotten my SQL basics, specifically Postgres. This meant brushing up on my database fundamentals, which reinforced the importance of not losing touch with basic concepts, no matter how advanced you become. But luckily I have ChatGPT on my side (serious tho :p)

Also, I overlooked changing the URL from localhost to my actual site (focusstopwatch.com). Lesson learned: Always, and I mean always, test your production environment!

Supabase tools that I used in FocusStopwatch.com, are:

1. Supabase **Auth Magic Link**. You can read more [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-magic-link)
2. Supabase **User Management Starter**. You can read more along the auth guide for Vue.js [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-vue-3)
3. Supabase create table UI

## **Wrapping it Up**

And that's a wrap on my journey in creating my first app with Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. It was an interesting journey filled with trials, errors, and numerous learning moments. If you have any questions or feedbacks, please kindly let me know. Thank you!
